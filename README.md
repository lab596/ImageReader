# ImageReader

Java
---
This is an image reader in which it takes an input of a JPG image (make sure you import the image you want to use to the IDE you are using) and scans pixel by pixel printing it out into a JFrame.
It is able to do a fully colored image (not initially intended) as well as a Grayscale image based on the rgb value of a pixel.

Python

As the initially defined probelem statement is easy to complete in python, a unique art type was implemented in reference to ascii art. The goal behind this is to transform an image to greyscale and then scan the value of grey on each pixel. Then using a value range we assign each to a specific character on the keyboard that roughly represents that greyscale value. Through this we are able to recreate the image using computer characters.

# Plans:
* To eventually be able to transfer a video in live time to the JFrame by drawing pixel by pixel.
* Enable facial recognition based on the video displayed
