# ImageReader
This is an image reader in which it takes an input of a JPG image (make sure you import the image you want to use to the IDE you are using) and scans pixel by pixel printing it out into a JFRAME.
It is able to do a fully colored image (not initially intended) as well as a Grayscale image based on the rgb value of a pixel.

Plans:
To eventually be able to transfer a video in live time to the JFrame by drawing pixel by pixel
Eventually from there recognize how facial regoinition workds and be able to recognize objects from a video
